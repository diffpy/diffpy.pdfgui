    This software was originally developed by the Billinge group as part
    of the Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron Scattering Experiments
    (DANSE) project funded by the US National Science Foundation under
    grant DMR-0520547. Developments of PDFfit2 were funded by NSF grant
    DMR-0304391 in the Billinge group, and with support from Michigan State
    University and Columbia University. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions
    or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s)
    and do not necessarily reflect the views of the respective funding bodies.
    Subsequent development was done in the Billinge group at Columbia University
    and then in collaboration between the Billinge group at Columbia and Pavol
    Juhas at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Moving forward, PDFgui will be
    maintained as a community project with contributions welcomed from many people.

    If you use this program to do productive scientific research that leads
    to publication, we ask that you acknowledge use of the program by citing

    Up to the release 1.1.2 (February 2017) the copyright was held by
    the institutions that hosted the work as follows:
    Copyright 2006-2007, Board of Trustees of Michigan State University,
    Copyright 2008-2012, Board of Trustees of Columbia University in the
    city of New York.
    Copyright 2013, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Copyright holder
    indicated in each source file).

    As of February 2017, and the 1.1.2 release, PDFgui has moved to a shared copyright model.

    PDFgui uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their
    contributions to PDFgui. But, it is important to note that these contributions are
    typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the PDFgui source code, in its entirety,
    is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective
    copyright of the entire PDFgui Development Team. If individual contributors want to
    maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
    should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit
    the change to one of the PDFgui repositories.

    The PDFgui Development Team is the set of all contributors to the PDFgui project.
    A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.
