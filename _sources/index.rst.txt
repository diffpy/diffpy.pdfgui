diffpy.pdfgui - GUI for PDF simulation and structure refinement.

| Software version |release|
| Last updated |today|

For users who do not have the expertise or necessity for command 
line analysis, PDFgui is a convenient and easy to use graphical front 
end for the PDFfit2 refinement program. It is capable of full-profile 
fitting of the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) derived from x-ray 
or neutron diffraction data and comes with built in graphical and structure 
visualization capabilities.

PDFgui is a friendly interface to the PDFfit2 refinement engine, with many
powerful extensions. To get started, please open the manual (:download:`html <../manual/pdfgui.html>`
/:download:`pdf <../manual/pdfgui.pdf>`) from the help menu or follow the :ref:`quick_start`.
