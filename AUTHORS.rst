DiffPy was initiated as part of the Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron
Scattering Experiments (DANSE) project, funded by the National Science
Foundation under grant DMR-0520547.  More information on DANSE can be

Acknowledgments
---------------

We are truly grateful to all the people who have contributed, in all
different ways, to this project:  Thomas Proffen, Xiangyun Qiu, Pete
Peterson and Jacques Bloch, previous Billinge-group members whose
contributions to the codes are living well beyond their affiliation with
the group; The hard working DANSE group at Caltech, University of
Maryland, Iowa State and University of Tennessee, especially Brent Fultz
for doggedly putting DANSE all together and Michael Aivazis, and the
indomitable Mike McKerns for their design input and MM's gargantuan
excel spreadsheets; The former members of the Billinge-group members,
especially HyunJeong Kim and Ahmad Masadeh for enthusiastic testing and
feature requests;  Last but not least, our long suffering family members,
and the whole coffee and tea industries at large, without whom none of
this would have been possible.
