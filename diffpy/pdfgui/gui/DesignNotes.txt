Copying and Pasting:
The project is going to allow copying and pasting on all levels of the fit
tree. By default, when changing the metadata or constraints of a copied
data set or structure, the change will be local. The same is true of chaning a
structure. If, however, many identical copies are selected simultaneously,
changes will take place to all of them. If many items are highlighted, but are
not identical, the display only shows information for the first item. If the
item is altered, the tree will indicate that only the first item is being
changed by highlighting only the first selected item.

Popups:
Popups are annoying. The right panel is there to serve any need of the user.
Instead of popping up dialogs, change the panel on the right hand side. This
looks cooler anyway.

Saving:
Must save the last step of a fitting with the project, even if the fitting was
not completed.

Results:
Display the results in an adendum notebook panel on the pertinent levels of
the tree.

Future Options:
* Highlight many items, copy from one to all others from right click.
* Remember history of constraints.
* Hava a "Link to results" copy option in the right click menu.
* Be able to describe a parameter. Hovering over the parameter in the windows
  where it appears will show user's description as a tool tip
